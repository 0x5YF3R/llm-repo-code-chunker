# LLM Text Compressor

A Python script designed to compress text generated by large language models (LLMs) using advanced text processing techniques. This can help reduce data size without significant loss of context or meaning, ideal for applications where storage and data transmission efficiency are crucial.

## Features

- **Text Compression**: Efficiently reduces the size of text outputs from LLMs.
- **Lossless Techniques**: Minimizes information loss during compression.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be used standalone or integrated into other projects.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- Install required libraries (if any) via:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository and navigate into the directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-text-compressor.git
   cd llm-text-compressor
   ```

2. Run the script with the required arguments:
   ```bash
   python llm_text_compressor.py --large_text <path_to_large_text_file> --token_target <number_of_tokens> --compressor_type <compression_type>
   ```

   - `--large_text`: Path to the large text file to be compressed.
   - `--token_target`: Target number of tokens for the final compressed output.
   - `--compressor_type`: Type of compression to apply. Options are as follows:
     - **general**: Standard compression for balanced summarization.
     - **bullet_points**: Converts text into bullet points for quick readability.
     - **key_points**: Extracts only the most essential points from the text.
     - **abstract**: Produces a brief abstract summarizing the main themes.
     - **outline**: Generates an outline format capturing key sections and flow.

   Optional:
   - `--json`: If set, outputs the result in JSON format.

3. The script will output the compressed version of the text based on the provided parameters.
